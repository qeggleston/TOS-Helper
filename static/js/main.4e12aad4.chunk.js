For example, these terms include the following topic headings:\nWhat you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services\nWhat we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services\nContent in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services - whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others\nIn case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms\nUnderstanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you\u2019re agreeing to these terms.\nBesides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy.

For example, Maps can remind you to leave for an appointment that appears in your Google Calendar.\nImprove Google services\nWe're constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to detect and block spam and malware, and to provide you with innovative features, like simultaneous translations. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.\nIf we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.\nWhat we expect from you\nFollow these terms and service-specific additional terms\nThe permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in:\nthese terms\nservice-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements\nWe also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services.

That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.\nService-related communications\nTo provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nIf you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.\nContent in Google services\nYour content\nSome of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available \u2014 for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.\nSee the Permission to use your content section for more about your rights in your content, and how your content is used in our services\nSee the Removing your content section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services\nIf you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement and we\u2019ll take appropriate action.

For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don\u2019t override those immunities.\nTaking action in case of problems\nBefore taking action as described below, we\u2019ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:\ncause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google\nviolate the law or a legal enforcement authority\u2019s order\ncompromise an investigation\ncompromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services\nRemoving your content\nIf we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, and content that infringes someone else\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nSuspending or terminating your access to Google services\nGoogle reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:\nyou materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies\nwe\u2019re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order\nwe reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google \u2014 for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn\u2019t belong to you\nIf you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.\nOf course, you\u2019re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we\u2019d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.\nSettling disputes, governing law, and courts\nFor information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.\nCalifornia law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, service-specific additional terms, or any related services, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.\nTo the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.\nAbout these terms\nBy law, you have certain rights that can\u2019t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.\nThese terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don\u2019t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.\nWe want to make these terms easy to understand, so we\u2019ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.\nIf these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.\nIf you don\u2019t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don\u2019t take action right away, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.\nWe may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business \u2014 for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.\nIf we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don\u2019t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.","Effective October 15, 2020.

We conditionally grant permission to crawl the Services in accordance with the parameters set forth in our robots.txt file, but scraping the Services without Reddit\u2019s prior consent is prohibited.\nUse the Services in any manner that we reasonably believe to be an abuse of or fraud on Reddit or any payment system.\nWe encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates these Terms or our Content Policy. We also support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security issue, please email security@reddit.com.\n\n7. Moderators\nModerating a subreddit is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the Services. We are not responsible for actions taken by the moderators. We reserve the right to revoke or limit a user\u2019s ability to moderate at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for a breach of these Terms.\n\nIf you choose to moderate a subreddit:\n\nYou agree to follow the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities;\nYou agree that when you receive reports related to a subreddit you moderate, you will take appropriate action, which may include removing content that violates policy and/or promptly escalating to Reddit for review;\nYou are not, and may not represent that you are, authorized to act on behalf of Reddit;\nYou may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf of Reddit, or any subreddits that you moderate, without our written approval;\nYou may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation, consideration, gift, or favor from third parties;\nIf you have access to non-public information as a result of moderating a subreddit, you will use such information only in connection with your performance as a moderator; and\nYou may create and enforce rules for the subreddits you moderate, provided that such rules do not conflict with these Terms, the Content Policy, or the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities.\nReddit reserves the right, but has no obligation, to overturn any action or decision of a moderator if Reddit, in its sole discretion, believes that such action or decision is not in the interest of Reddit or the Reddit community.\n\n8. Copyright, Trademark, the DMCA, and Takedowns\nReddit respects the intellectual property of others and requires that users of our Services do the same. We have a policy that includes the removal of any infringing material from the Services and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our Services who are repeat infringers. If you believe that anything on our Services infringes a copyright or a trademark that you own or control, you may notify Reddit\u2019s Designated Agent by filling out our Copyright Report Form or Trademark Report Form, or by contacting:\n\nCopyright Agent\nReddit, Inc.\n1455 Market Street, Suite 1600\nSan Francisco, CA 94103\ncopyright@reddit.com\n\nAlso, please note that if you knowingly misrepresent that any activity or material on our Service is infringing, you may be liable to Reddit for certain costs and damages.\n\nIf we remove Your Content in response to a copyright or trademark notice, we will notify you via Reddit\u2019s private messaging system. If you believe Your Content was wrongly removed due to a mistake or misidentification in a copyright notice, you can send a counter notification via our Copyright Counter Notice Form or to our Copyright Agent (contact information provided above).

However, some services, including Reddit Premium and Virtual Goods, may be available for purchase (\u201cPaid Services\u201d). In addition to these Terms, by purchasing or using Reddit Premium or our Virtual Goods, you further agree to the Reddit Premium and Virtual Goods Agreement.\n\nReddit may change the fees or benefits associated with the Paid Services from time to time with reasonable advance notice of material changes; provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the Paid Services.\n\nYou may submit your debit card, credit card, or other payment information (\u201cPayment Information\u201d) via our Services to purchase the Paid Services.

Indemnity\nExcept to the extent prohibited by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, third-party service providers, and licensors (the \u201cReddit Entities\u201d) harmless from any claim or demand, including costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) your use of the Services, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations, or (d) Your Content. We reserve the right to control the defense of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.\n\n11. Disclaimers\nTHE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d AND \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING THOSE BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND EVEN IF THE REDDIT ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF ANY REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.\n\n13.

By continuing to access or use the Services on or after the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Services before the changes become effective.\n\n15. Additional Terms\nBecause we offer a variety of Services, you may be asked to agree to additional terms before using a specific product or service offered by Reddit (\u201cAdditional Terms\u201d).

You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.

These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger, and the other products, features, apps, services, technologies, and software we offer (the Facebook Products or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. These Products are provided to you by Facebook, Inc.\n\nWe don\u2019t charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms. Instead, businesses and organizations pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think will be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which ads to show you.\n\nWe don\u2019t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don\u2019t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things like the kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more.\n\nOur Data Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your settings at any time to review the privacy choices you have about how we use your data.\nReturn to top\n1. The services we provide\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:\nProvide a personalized experience for you:\nYour experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have - for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to personalize your experience.\nConnect you with people and organizations you care about:\nWe help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that matter to you across the Facebook Products you use. We use the data we have to make suggestions for you and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups, and organizations they care about.\nEmpower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:\nThere are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.\nHelp you discover content, products, and services that may interest you:\nWe show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Facebook Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.\nCombat harmful conduct and protect and support our community:\nPeople will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Facebook Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products.\nUse and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:\nWe use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.\nResearch ways to make our services better:\nWe engage in research to develop, test, and improve our Products. This includes analyzing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our Data Policy explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.\nProvide consistent and seamless experiences across the Facebook Company Products:\nOur Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different Facebook Company Products that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with a business you follow on Facebook through Messenger.\nEnable global access to our services:\nTo operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content and data in our data centers and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. This infrastructure may be operated or controlled by Facebook, Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or its affiliates.\nReturn to top\n2. How our services are funded\nInstead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.\nProtecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be interested.\nWe also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We don\u2019t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Facebook ads work here.\nWe collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above to you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Data Policy. You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. Learn more.\nReturn to top\n3. Your commitments to Facebook and our community\nWe provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:\n1. Who can use Facebook\nWhen people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:\nUse the same name that you use in everyday life.\nProvide accurate information about yourself.\nCreate only one account (your own) and use your timeline for personal purposes.\nNot share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).\nWe try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:\nYou are under 13 years old.\nYou are a convicted sex offender.\nWe've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms or Policies.\nYou are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or software under applicable laws.\n2. What you can share and do on Facebook\nWe want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):\nYou may not use our Products to do or share anything:\nThat violates these Terms, our Community Standards, and other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook.\nThat is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.\nThat infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights.\nYou may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of our Products.\nYou may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.\nWe can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions.\nIf we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community Standards, we\u2019ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.\nTo help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.\nWe also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\n3. The permissions you give us\nWe need certain permissions from you to provide our services:\nPermission to use content you create and share: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.\nYou own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.\nHowever, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a \u2018license\u2019) to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.\nSpecifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other Facebook Products you use.This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems.\nYou can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. Learn more about how to delete your account. You can download a copy of your data at any time before deleting your account.\nWhen you delete content, it\u2019s no longer visible to other users, however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:\nimmediate deletion is not possible due to technical limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted within a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);\nyour content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or\nwhere immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:\ninvestigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);\ncomply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or\ncomply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;\nin which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).\nIn each of the above cases, this license will continue until the content has been fully deleted.\nPermission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've taken on Facebook. You can learn more about your ad settings and preferences.\nPermission to update software you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.\n4. Limits on using our intellectual property\nIf you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.\nReturn to top\n4. Additional provisions\n1. Updating our Terms\nWe work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.\nWe hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Facebook community, you can delete your account at any time.\n2. Account suspension or termination\nWe want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.\nIf we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community Standards, we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people\u2019s intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.\nWhere we take such action we\u2019ll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; or where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.\nYou can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your account by mistake.\nIf you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5.\n3. Limits on liability\nWe work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided \"as is,\" and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content).\nWe cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the Facebook Products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Facebook Products will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.\n4. Disputes\nWe try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.\nFor any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products (\"claim\"), you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.\n5. Other\nThese Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.\nSome of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.\nIf any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.\nYou will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent.\nYou may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialized. Only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is memorialized.\nThese Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
