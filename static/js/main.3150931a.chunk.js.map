As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.\nIf we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.\nWhat we expect from you\nFollow these terms and service-specific additional terms\nThe permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in:\nthese terms\nservice-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements\nWe also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site.\nAlthough we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.\nRespect others\nMany of our services allow you to interact with others.

If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide a fair process as described in the Taking action in case of problems section.\nPermission to use your content\nSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.\nLicense\nYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.\nWe need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.\nWhat's covered\nThis license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nWhat's not covered\nThis license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it's only about your intellectual property rights\nThis license doesn’t cover these types of content:\npublicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.\nfeedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the Service-related communications section below.\nScope\nThis license is:\nworldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world\nnon-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others\nroyalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license\nRights\nThis license allows Google to:\nhost, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go\npublish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others\nmodify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it\nsublicense these rights to:\nother users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose\nour contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below\nPurpose\nThis license is for the limited purpose of:\noperating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:\nfor spam, malware, and illegal content\nto recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together\nto customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in Ads Settings)\nThis analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.\nusing content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.\ndeveloping new technologies and services for Google consistent with these terms\nDuration\nThis license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.\nIf you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:\nIf you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.\nIf you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.\nUsing Google services\nYour Google Account\nIf you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.\nYou’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.\nUsing Google services on behalf of an organization\nMany organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our services. To use our services on behalf of an organization:\nan authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms\nyour organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.\nService-related communications\nTo provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s Privacy Policy.\nIf you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.\nContent in Google services\nYour content\nSome of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.\nSee the Permission to use your content section for more about your rights in your content, and how your content is used in our services\nSee the Removing your content section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services\nIf you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center.\nGoogle content\nSome of our services include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.\nOther content\nFinally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.\nSoftware in Google services\nSome of our services include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.\nThe license we give you is:\nworldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world\nnon-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others\nroyalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license\npersonal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else\nnon-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else\nSome of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.\nYou may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software. Also, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written permission or applicable law lets you do so.\nWhen a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.\nIn case of problems or disagreements\nBy law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong. These terms don’t limit or take away any of those rights. For example, if you’re a consumer, then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law.\nWarranty\nWe provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.\nDisclaimers\nThe only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are (1) described in the Warranty section, (2) stated in the service-specific additional terms, or (3) provided under applicable laws. We don’t make any other commitments about our services.\nAnd unless required by law, we don’t provide implied warranties, such as the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\nLiabilities\nFor all users\nThese terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms don’t limit Google’s liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.\nOther than the rights and responsibilities described in this section (In case of problems or disagreements), Google won’t be responsible for any other losses, unless they’re caused by our breach of these terms or service-specific additional terms.\nFor business users and organizations only\nIf you’re a business user or organization, then to the extent allowed by applicable law:\nYou’ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.\nGoogle won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:\nloss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings\nindirect or consequential loss\npunitive damages\nGoogle’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach\nIf you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.\nTaking action in case of problems\nBefore taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:\ncause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google\nviolate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order\ncompromise an investigation\ncompromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services\nRemoving your content\nIf we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.\nSuspending or terminating your access to Google services\nGoogle reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:\nyou materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies\nwe’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order\nwe reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you\nIf you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.\nOf course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.\nSettling disputes, governing law, and courts\nFor information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.\nCalifornia law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, service-specific additional terms, or any related services, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.\nTo the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.\nAbout these terms\nBy law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.\nThese terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.\nWe want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.\nIf these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.\nIf you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.\nWe may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.\nIf we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.`,\n`Effective October 15, 2020.

If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the rest of the Terms will remain in effect. You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent. We may freely assign any of our rights and obligations under these Terms.\n\nContact Information\nReddit, Inc.\n1455 Market Street, Suite 1600\nSan Francisco, CA 94103\nUnited States\n\nAuthorized to receive service in Germany on behalf of Reddit, Inc. for administrative and judicial proceedings within the meaning of Section 5(1) of the Network Enforcement Act:\n\nTaylor Wessing PartG mbB\n- NetzDG-Zustellungen -\nAm Sandtorkai 41\n20457 Hamburg\nGermany`,\n`Terms of Service\n\n\nWelcome to Facebook!\n\nFacebook builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities, and grow businesses. These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger, and the other products, features, apps, services, technologies, and software we offer (the Facebook Products or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. These Products are provided to you by Facebook, Inc.\n\nWe don’t charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms. Instead, businesses and organizations pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think will be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which ads to show you.\n\nWe don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things like the kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more.\n\nOur Data Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your settings at any time to review the privacy choices you have about how we use your data.\nReturn to top\n1. The services we provide\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:\nProvide a personalized experience for you:\nYour experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have - for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to personalize your experience.\nConnect you with people and organizations you care about:\nWe help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that matter to you across the Facebook Products you use. We use the data we have to make suggestions for you and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups, and organizations they care about.\nEmpower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:\nThere are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.\nHelp you discover content, products, and services that may interest you:\nWe show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Facebook Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.\nCombat harmful conduct and protect and support our community:\nPeople will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Facebook Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products.\nUse and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:\nWe use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.\nResearch ways to make our services better:\nWe engage in research to develop, test, and improve our Products. This includes analyzing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our Data Policy explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.\nProvide consistent and seamless experiences across the Facebook Company Products:\nOur Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different Facebook Company Products that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with a business you follow on Facebook through Messenger.\nEnable global access to our services:\nTo operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content and data in our data centers and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. This infrastructure may be operated or controlled by Facebook, Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or its affiliates.\nReturn to top\n2. How our services are funded\nInstead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.\nProtecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be interested.\nWe also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Facebook ads work here.\nWe collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above to you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Data Policy. You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. Learn more.\nReturn to top\n3. Your commitments to Facebook and our community\nWe provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:\n1. Who can use Facebook\nWhen people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:\nUse the same name that you use in everyday life.\nProvide accurate information about yourself.\nCreate only one account (your own) and use your timeline for personal purposes.\nNot share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).\nWe try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:\nYou are under 13 years old.\nYou are a convicted sex offender.\nWe've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms or Policies.\nYou are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or software under applicable laws.\n2. What you can share and do on Facebook\nWe want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):\nYou may not use our Products to do or share anything:\nThat violates these Terms, our Community Standards, and other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook.\nThat is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.\nThat infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights.\nYou may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of our Products.\nYou may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.\nWe can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions.\nIf we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community Standards, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.\nTo help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.\nWe also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\n3. The permissions you give us\nWe need certain permissions from you to provide our services:\nPermission to use content you create and share: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.\nYou own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.\nHowever, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a ‘license’) to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.\nSpecifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other Facebook Products you use.This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems.\nYou can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. Learn more about how to delete your account. You can download a copy of your data at any time before deleting your account.\nWhen you delete content, it’s no longer visible to other users, however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:\nimmediate deletion is not possible due to technical limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted within a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);\nyour content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or\nwhere immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:\ninvestigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);\ncomply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or\ncomply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;\nin which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).\nIn each of the above cases, this license will continue until the content has been fully deleted.\nPermission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've taken on Facebook. You can learn more about your ad settings and preferences.\nPermission to update software you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.\n4. Limits on using our intellectual property\nIf you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.\nReturn to top\n4. Additional provisions\n1. Updating our Terms\nWe work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.\nWe hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Facebook community, you can delete your account at any time.\n2. Account suspension or termination\nWe want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.\nIf we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community Standards, we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.\nWhere we take such action we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; or where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.\nYou can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your account by mistake.\nIf you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5.\n3. Limits on liability\nWe work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided \"as is,\" and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content).\nWe cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the Facebook Products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Facebook Products will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.\n4. Disputes\nWe try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.\nFor any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products (\"claim\"), you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.\n5. Other\nThese Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.\nSome of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.\nIf any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.\nYou will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent.\nYou may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialized. Only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is memorialized.\nThese Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.\nYou should know that we may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).\nWe always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But you should know that we may use them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.\nWe reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.\nReturn to top\n5.
